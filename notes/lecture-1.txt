Knowledge

    - Knowledge-Based Agents
        Agents that reasons by operating on internal representations of knowledge
        - Example: 
            1) If it didn’t rain, Harry visited Hagrid today.
            2) Harry visited Hagrid or Dumbledore today, but not both.
            3) Harry visited Dumbledore today.
            - Therefore
                4) Harry did not visit Hagrid
                5) It rained today

    - Sentence
        An assertion about the world in a knowledge representation language.
            - Is how AI stores knowledge and uses it to infer new information.

Propositional Logic
    Based on propositions, states about the word that can be either true or false.

    - Propositional Symbols
        Are most often letters (P, Q, R) that are used to represent a proposition.
        
    - Logical Connectives
        Logical symbols that connect propositional symbols in order to reason in a more complex way about the world.
        -Not (¬) inverses the truth value of the proposition.
            Example, if P: “It is raining,” then ¬P: “It is not raining”.
        -And (∧) connects two different propositions.
            When these two proposition, P and Q, are connected by ∧, the resulting proposition P ∧ Q is true only in the case that both P and Q are true.
        -Or (∨) is true as as long as either of its arguments is true. 
            This means that for P ∨ Q to be true, at least one of P or Q has to be true.

            It is worthwhile to mention that there are two types of Or: an inclusive Or and an exclusive Or. 
                In an exclusive Or, P ∨ Q is false if P ∧ Q is true. That is, an exclusive Or requires only one of its arguments to be true and not both. 
                An inclusive Or is true if any of P, Q, or P ∧ Q is true. In the case of Or (∨), the intention is an inclusive Or.

            Sometimes an example helps understand inclusive versus exclusive Or. 
                Inclusive Or: “in order to eat dessert, you have to clean your room or mow the lawn.” In this case, if you do both chores, you will still get the cookies. 
                Exclusive Or: “For dessert, you can have either cookies or ice cream.” In this case, you can’t have both.
            
            If you are curious, the exclusive Or is often shortened to XOR and a common symbol for it is ⊕).
